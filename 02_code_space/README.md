### Ball detection
TrackNet was used for detecting tennis ball during the game. For more information you can check this repository: https://github.com/yastrebksv/TrackNet. There you can find 
pretrained weights to check the model.

### Bounce detection
CatBoostRegressor was used to predict ball's bounces during the game based on ball trajectory detected in the previous step. You can check this pretrained model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Eo5HDnAQE8y_FbOftKZ8pjiojwuy2BmJ/view?usp=drive_link 

### Court detection
It was used neural network for detection 14 points of tennis court. For more information you can check this repository: https://github.com/yastrebksv/TennisCourtDetector. There you can find pretrained weights to check the model.
